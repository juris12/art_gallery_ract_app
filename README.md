## I developed a simple web application build using React, SASS and Typescript.

I created additional gallery page with infinite scrolling functionality. Scrolling functionality has small bug that on initial page loading fetches identical artworks 3 times.

Project is structured with code maintainability in mind. Each page and component has its own folder with .tsx and .scss files. Additionally, I have added types to responses. There also error messages in case of bad server response.
